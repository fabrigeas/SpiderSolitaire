## Todo

Because the game was developed because I was bored, no test has been carried out, no design pattern was used.
I simply developped the game on the go.
It took me about 16hours of work.

The following still need to be implemented

- Implement test using Mocha and nightwatch
- Check that the game is completed
- Check the number of card per game difficulty
