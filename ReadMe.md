# Spider Solitaire

Hello world,

This is hobby spider solitaire game that I developed because I was bored.

## Quickstart

Clone or download the game into your compter.
Browse to the folder where the game is saved and double click on index.html
enjoy.

## Technology and game features

The game is written in Vanilla Javascript, html and css. There is a game timer to track how long a player spent in a given game.

## Todo

Because the game was developed because I was bored, no test has been carried out, no design pattern was used.
I simply developped the game on the go.
It took me about 16hours of work.

The following still need to be implemented

- Implement test using Mocha and nightwatch
- Check that the game is completed
- Check the number of card per game difficulty
